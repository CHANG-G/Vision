Ncut
====

A MATLAB implementation of Normalized Cut (Shi and Malik, PAMI 2000) for the problem of segmenting 2D point sets. 


###### Overview ####

Ncut implements the classic algorithm "Normalized Cut", published by Shi and Malik in ICCV 1997 and PAMI 2000. We implement the algorithm for segmenting point sets.
This corresponds to the first bullet-point in section 4 of the PAMI paper.


###### Dependencies #####

The code has been implemented in MATLAB R2014b, and runs on both Linux and Windows 64-bit.


###### Directory Structure ######

The "images" directory contains some MATLAB plots produced by our algorithm during test runs. The top-level directory contains two MATLAB functions and one MATLAB script,
both of which are adourned with helpful comments to aid understanding of the code.

###### Running ######

Running "test_normalized_cut_points" produces random two-dimensional data, runs the normalized cut algorithm, and then color-codes the different clusters discovered by the algorithm.
The function "normalized_cut_points.m" controls the static threshold used to discretize the continuous solution found by the algorithm (see either paper for details of
how the optimization works). The reader may employ different thresholds if the results appear unsatisfactory.
