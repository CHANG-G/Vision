Texture Synthesis
=================

A MATLAB implementation of the classic texture synthesis algorithm by Efros and Leung.


###### Overview #######

"Texture Synthesis" is a set of MATLAB scripts and functions which implement the classic algorithm by Efros and Leung, published in ICCV '99. 


###### Dependencies ######

The code has been tested on MATLAB R2014b on Windows and Linux, and needs only MATLAB's Image Processing toolbox to run.


##### Directory structure ######

The "input_textures" and "output_textures" directories contain textures that can be used as seeds for synthesizing textures, as well as synthesized textures, respectively.
The top-level directory contains a bunch of .m files, all of which have been thoroughly commented to aid the reader in understanding what the code does.

###### Running #######

Running "synthesize_textures" should load three seed textures from "input_textures" and synthesize textures which are subsequently stored in "output_textures". The current
version of the code synthesizes a highly regular brick texture, a more stochastic rice texture, as well as some free text. For efficiency reasons, we synthesize textures
of the same size (width, height) as the input texture.
